# Coral-Reef-Health-Visualization-Project

# Overview

This project aims to visualize the health of coral reefs over time, focusing on key indicators such as coral cover percentage, bleaching events, and water temperature. By analyzing and visualizing data from the Great Barrier Reef, we can gain insights into the impacts of environmental changes on coral ecosystems. This project utilizes Python for data processing and visualization, making use of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of simulated annual records for the Great Barrier Reef, covering various metrics including:

* Year
* Coral Cover (%)
* Bleaching Events
* Water Temperature (Â°C)

This sample data is provided in a CSV file named coral_reef_data.csv.

# Data Visualization 

With the data loaded and processed, the 'visualize_coral_health_over_time' function takes over to create visual representations of the coral reef health metrics. It uses Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful Python libraries for data visualization, to generate plots that highlight trends and patterns in the data.

* Coral Cover Over Time: A line plot is generated to show how the coral cover percentage has changed over the years. This visualization helps in understanding the overall health of the coral reef ecosystem and how it has been affected over time.

* Bleaching Events and Water Temperature: While the primary example focuses on coral cover, the framework allows for additional visualizations, such as the frequency of bleaching events and changes in water temperature. These factors are crucial for analyzing the environmental stresses coral reefs face and can be visualized using bar charts, scatter plots, or heatmaps.

# Insights and Analysis 
Once we have all the graphs, we can easily anaylse them for observed trends, anomalies, or notable patterns. This section is where the user can elaborate on the implications of the data, such as the impact of rising water temperatures on coral bleaching events or the resilience of coral reefs to environmental changes.
